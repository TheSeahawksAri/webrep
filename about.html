<h1 style="font-size: 40px;"><b>Welcome to the About Section of the IAR Website!</b></h1>
<p>Hello Everybody, today we will learn all about the friends in the friend group. Just to recap the friends in the group are: Aryaman, Reed, Timur, Lucas, Eddie, Nikhil, Ehaan, and Dingchen. 
<br>
<br>
    Out of all of us, the most active in the group chat is probably Timur because he has nothing else to do in his life. The second most active is probably Luke because he is a pick me type of guy. The third most active is Eddie because he posts his Brawl Stars clips and lets us know about everything he does. I am the least active because I am god and I have to tend to the problems in this world, so I dont have much time to talk on measly little group chats.
<br>
<br>
    Our friend group usually goes to the mall on the weekends to just hang out. Usually I am not able to go because I am the greatest and am above small litlle mall excursions. Its totally not because my mom told me I can't go. When my friends go to the mall, they eat food and they buy things with the money they bring. They exhaust a lot of money every Sunday.
<br>
<br>
    Every time someone has a birthday we go to their sleepover. Its usually really fun except if we all start fighting. But usually we dont fight and we all come out alive. Its really fun, and the most recent birthday was Ehaan's birthday. We went to an escape room and we had a ton of fun.
<br>
<br>
    In conclusion our friend group is the greatest to exist ever....
