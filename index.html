        <h1><b>Welcome to the Official Website for IAR!</b></h1>
                <p>This is the official website for IAR. IAR is our friendgroup full of eccentric people, to say the least.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    IAR consists of the following people: Aryaman, Reed, Timur, Lucas, Eddie, Nikhil, Ehaan, and Dingchen. In this website, you will find many different funny photos of our friends, and you will learn a lot about each of them. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many features of this website that have not been completed so please tell me (Aryaman also God) if you need any changes or would like to view the updated website.  </p>
